# Cursors

> Exploring explicit and implicit communication through cursors

Cursors is a small exploration about explicit and implicit communication in collaborative whiteboarding software (ex. [Miro](https://miro.com/), [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/)), where cursors and how they're displayed to others play a key role in real-time communication with collaborators.
